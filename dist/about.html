                <br>
                <p>As a life-long learner and highly motivated individual I spend much
                    of my free time reading about and practicing web development. I have always been very
                    interested in developing web sites and creating application. I've attended the University of
                    North Carolina Boot Camp for coding to further my education.


                    Iam passionate about building tools which enable people to better themselves. I'm also
                    deeply fascinated by how technology enables us to store and transmit vast amounts of
                    information in fractions of a second. I work daily to understand how this process works and
                    to gain the skills needed to add something meaningful to this process.

                    I enjoy most activities which are competitive and repetitive, which is what drew me to
                    coding. The feeling of iteratively improving at the certain task is something that motivates
                    me in many aspects.</p>

                <h1>Full Stack Developer</h1>
                <h3> I enjoy learning up and coming new langues,libraries, databases and basic designs to get the full
                    understanding of both
                    front and back end of development. It is always changing and I enjoy the challenges that comes with
                    the complexity of full stack development. During my time at UNC's Boot Camp I was able to learn the
                    most current programming langues and were tested each week to make sure I understood the material.

                <h1>Front End Developer</h1>
                <h3>Learning the ins and outs of the front end gave me great understanding of how HTML, CSS, and
                    Javascript provides the visual of a web page. It's exciting to link together the world of design and
                    technology, packaging up the utility of the back end in an inviting way for users to interact with.
                    Programming takes website design files and convert them into HTML, JavaScript and/or CSS code - the
                    core elements of front-end development. </h3>

                    Java platform. It is something that I strive to understand for many reasons. Specializing in data
                    storing and organizing adds value in what I can do. Learning MySQL and MongoDB has been an
                    enlightening experience.</h3>
