## Description 

I was able to incorporate Sass a new programming language. It is a style sheet language that is an extension of CSS which helps keep things organized and allows you to create style sheets faster. Brittany's portfolio was created to display detailed information about future and current projects, her background that includes interests and her passions. There is also a contact that page that you will be able to send her an email if you like to discuss future business.
